###  Notes, Requests, ect

1. Lesson 0

   1. Image sequence in the slide show presented in the image files allows for swift placement in the markdown. Just a suggestion moving forward for organization. This will also help others as it gets put into JSON/myGA/DataArt

   2. I cannot create a table without border (referencing Lesson 0, slide 1). What you will need to do is put all of these images with the names underneath them into one image.

   3. Lesson 0, slide 3: we need an explanation for the question's answer. You dont need to reiterate the correct answer but rather: say something like: "That's Right! Such such is like such such because the world is round and I like roses." :)

   4. Same for Slide 4 in this lesson: we also seem to be missing some choices.

   5. Your references need to have text, followed by a full url with "http://" infront for markdown. I write links as such: [Linked Text](http://www.###.com)

   6. After consolidating lesson 0, it is only 5 slides long. We may want to consider adding more lessons to this or bunching it with lesson 1. A thought only, I think the minimum is 5, but I'll check for you and get back.
   
  RE LESSON 0: I apologize, there were some hidden slides in this file that I didn't want transferred. But I think you're right about it being too short anyway - I will migrate the 3 slides into lesson 1. 

2. Lesson 5
   1. Slide 16, We are missing the wistia link for the Didi-Relationship Video-- plus any additional videos
   --- Yes, I'm still waiting on these links - should get by tomorrow. 

   2. In past courses all images pulled from the web needed to be redone and designed a certain way-- I'm unsure if this requirement is held across all courses, but it would be worth finding out to fix them now instead of later.
   ---- I will follow up with Monica to see what I need to do here. 

3. Lesson 6
   1. Video links needed

   2. Are the text portions under the videos
    transcripts? This isn't clear:/
    ---- Yes they are! 

4. Lesosn 7
   1. Slide 6 is missing an explanation for the question
   --- That's right! Read on to learn how they did it.  
   2. Slide 9: explanation needed
   3. We are missing topics for this lesson
    --- Nailed it! Read on to learn what they did. 
   Topic: 
   Wilkinson Sword Case Study
